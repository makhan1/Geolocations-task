International Space Station Pass Times
The international space station (ISS) is an orbital outpost circling high above out heads. Sometimes it’s overhead, but when? It depends on your location. Given a location on Earth (latitude, longitude, and altitude) this API will compute the next n number of times that the ISS will be overhead.

Overhead is defined as 10° in elevation for the observer. The times are computed in UTC and the length of time that the ISS is above 10° is in seconds.

This gives you enough information to compute pass times for up to several weeks, but beware! times are less and less accurate as you go into the future. This is because the orbit of the ISS decays unpredictably over time and because station controllers periodically move the station to higher and lower orbits for docking, re-boost, and debris avoidance.

Overview
The API returns a list of upcoming ISS passes for a particular location formatted as JSON.

As input it expects a latitude/longitude pair, altitude and how many results to return. All fields are required.

As output you get the same inputs back (for checking) and a time stamp when the API ran in addition to a success or failure message and a list of passes. Each pass has a duration in seconds and a rise time as a unix time stamp.

Input
This API has 2 required input values and 2 optional ones.

Inptut	Description	Query string	Valid Range	Units	Required?
Latitude	The latitude of the place to predict passes	lat	-80..80	degrees	YES
Longitude	The longitude of the place to predict passes	lon	-180..180	degrees	YES
Altitude	The altitude of the place to predict passes	alt	0..10,000	meters	No
Number	The number of passes to return	n	1..100	–	No
Output
JSON
http://api.open-notify.org/iss-pass.json?lat=LAT&lon=LON

{
  "message": "success",
  "request": {
    "latitude": LATITUE,
    "longitude": LONGITUDE, 
    "altitude": ALTITUDE,
    "passes": NUMBER_OF_PASSES,
    "datetime": REQUEST_TIMESTAMP
  },
  "response": [
    {"risetime": TIMESTAMP, "duration": DURATION},
    ...
  ]
}
JSONP
Appending a callback request to the query string will return JSONP:

http://api.open-notify.org/iss-pass.json?lat=LAT&lon=LON&callback=CALLBACK

CALLBACK({
  "message": "success",
  "request": {
    "latitude": LATITUE,
    "longitude": LONGITUDE, 
    "altitude": ALTITUDE,
    "passes": NUMBER_OF_PASSES,
    "datetime": REQUEST_TIMESTAMP
  },
  "response": [
    {"risetime": TIMESTAMP, "duration": DURATION},
    ...
  ]
})
The values used to calculate the upcoming passes are returned in the request object. The response is a list of the timestamp or each pass along with the duration in seconds.
