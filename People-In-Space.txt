How many humans are in space right now?

Overview
This API returns the current number of people in space. When known it also returns the names and spacecraft those people are on. This API takes no inputs.

Output
JSON
http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json

{
  "message": "success",
  "number": NUMBER_OF_PEOPLE_IN_SPACE,
  "people": [
    {"name": NAME, "craft": SPACECRAFT_NAME},
    ...
  ]
}
JSONP
Appending a callback request to the query string will return JSONP:

http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json?callback=CALLBACK

CALLBACK({
  "message": "success",
  "number": %NUMBER_OF_PEOPLE_IN_SPACE%,
  "people": [
    {"name": %NAME%, "craft": %SPACECRAFT_NAME%},
    ...
  ]
})
Examples
Here is an example using jquery:

$.getJSON('http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json', function(data) {
  console.log(data['number'])
});
This should log the number of people in space to the console.

Data Source
I gather and update this data personally as launches and landing occur. There is no official source of data for this kind of thing.
